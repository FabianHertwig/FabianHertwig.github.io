# Writing Style Guide (Derived from Awesome Data Products Post)

**Overarching Goal: Excellent Reader Experience**

This document outlines the key characteristics of the desired writing style, based on the analysis of the blog post `docs/_posts/2022-01-04-awesome-data-products.md`.

The primary goal is to provide readers with an informative, engaging, and easily digestible experience. The style should balance accessibility with technical depth, catering to both quick skimming and deeper dives.

## 1. Introduction

*   **Concise Core Concept:** Start by stating the main idea or problem clearly and directly.
    *   *Example:* "A useful product attracts more users which generate data that can be used to improve the product."
*   **Immediate Relevance:** Quickly connect the concept to recognizable, high-profile examples to establish importance and leverage reader curiosity.
    *   *Example:* "Tesla uses it to improve the Autopilot, Netflix to show the right movies..."
*   **Clear Purpose Statement:** Explicitly state what the reader will learn or what the post will cover.
    *   *Example:* "In this post I will explain the concept and show how these companies implement it."
*   **Avoid:** Lengthy personal anecdotes or overly narrative openings that delay getting to the point.

## 2. Tone and Voice: Professional Engagement

*   **Professional yet Engaging:** Maintain a knowledgeable and informative tone. Enthusiasm is good, but avoid overly casual language, slang, or excessive personalization.
*   **Engage through Content:**
    *   Use relevant **storytelling** sparingly to illustrate points or provide context.
    *   Leverage **real-world examples** that readers can relate to.
    *   Pique **reader curiosity** by highlighting interesting problems, solutions, or implications.
*   **Direct Address (Sparingly):** Use "you," "we," and "let's" strategically to involve the reader without being overly conversational.
    *   *Example:* "If **you** like, watch it...", "let **us** look at some companies..."
*   **Limited First Person:** Use "I" minimally.
*   **Evidence-Based:** Ground claims in examples, evidence, and clear explanations.

## 3. Explanation Depth, Structure, and Conciseness

*   **Clarity First:** Explain concepts and terms in simple language initially, ensuring broad understanding.
*   **Layered Explanations:** Structure explanations to go from simple to in-depth. Start with the core idea, then elaborate with details, examples, and nuances.
    *   Use concrete, **relatable examples** (well-known companies, everyday situations) to make abstract concepts tangible.
    *   Provide specific details (technical terms, process steps) for those seeking deeper understanding.
*   **Provide Resources:** Offer ways for interested readers to learn more (links to documentation, papers, relevant media like videos or code snippets).
*   **Logical Structure & Skimmability:**
    *   Use clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists effectively to organize information.
    *   Ensure a logical flow that allows readers to easily follow the argument or explanation.
*   **Avoid Redundancy:** Do not repeat information unless it provides a genuinely new perspective, clarifies a complex point from a different angle, or serves as a necessary summary.
*   **Compress for Clarity:** Write concisely. Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases. Ensure the text is as compressed as possible *without sacrificing understandability*.

## 4. Formatting and Emphasis for Readability

*   **Strategic Bolding:** Use **bold text** purposefully to highlight:
    *   Key terms upon introduction (e.g., **Patch**, **Diff**, **Fuzzy Matching**).
    *   Key takeaways or impactful statements, aiding skimmability.
    *   *Example:* "**This detailed attention to indentation is crucial**..."
*   **Code Formatting:** Use backticks for `inline code` and fenced code blocks (``` `````) for multi-line code, examples, or technical formats.
*   **Visual Aids:** Incorporate images or diagrams where they significantly aid understanding.
*   **References:** Use footnotes or a dedicated reference section.

## Summary

The style prioritizes the reader's experience through clarity, engagement, and efficient communication. It respects the reader by providing layered information suitable for both skimming and in-depth learning, using relatable examples and clear structure, all while maintaining a professional tone and concise language.
