# Writing Style Guide

**Overarching Goal: Excellent Reader Experience**

This document outlines the key characteristics of the desired writing style, drawing inspiration from science communicators like **Tim Urban (Wait But Why)**, **Bill Bryson (A Short History of Nearly Everything)**, and **Robert Sapolsky**.

The primary goal is to provide readers with an informative, engaging, and easily digestible experience. The style should balance accessibility with scientific depth, making complex topics feel fascinating rather than intimidating.

## 1. Introduction

*   **Concise Core Concept:** Start by stating the main idea or problem clearly and directly.
    *   *Example:* "A useful product attracts more users which generate data that can be used to improve the product."
*   **Immediate Relevance:** Quickly connect the concept to recognizable, high-profile examples to establish importance and leverage reader curiosity.
    *   *Example:* "Tesla uses it to improve the Autopilot, Netflix to show the right movies..."
*   **Clear Purpose Statement:** Explicitly state what the reader will learn or what the post will cover.
    *   *Example:* "In this post I will explain the concept and show how these companies implement it."
*   **Avoid:** Lengthy personal anecdotes or overly narrative openings that delay getting to the point.

## 2. Tone and Voice: Conversational Science Communication

*   **Conversational yet Knowledgeable:** Write like you're explaining something fascinating to a smart friend over coffee. Enthusiasm is encouraged—if the topic is genuinely interesting, let that show.
*   **Storytelling as a Core Tool:**
    *   **Tell the story of discovery:** Who figured this out? How? What surprised them? (Bryson-style)
    *   **Use vivid scenarios:** "Imagine you're a monkey reaching for a treat..." makes neuroscience tangible
    *   **Historical context:** Science is a human endeavor—include the humans
*   **Humor and Relatability:**
    *   Self-deprecating observations are welcome ("We've all done this...")
    *   Absurdist comparisons can illuminate complex ideas (Wait But Why style)
    *   Don't force jokes, but don't suppress genuine wit either
*   **Direct Address:** Use "you" freely to involve the reader. The reader should feel like a participant, not an observer.
    *   *Example:* "Your brain just did something it's been doing for 500 million years."
*   **First Person is Fine:** Use "I" when sharing genuine observations or guiding the reader through your thought process.
*   **Evidence-Based Wonder:** Ground claims in research, but frame discoveries as *interesting* rather than just *true*. The reader should think "wow, that's fascinating" not just "okay, noted."

## 3. Explanation Depth and Structure

*   **Build Understanding in Layers:**
    *   Start with the intuitive version—what does this *feel* like?
    *   Then add the mechanism—how does it actually work?
    *   Then add the nuance—what's the scientific consensus and where are the edges?
    *   (Sapolsky's approach: fundamentals → complexity → real-world implications)
*   **Analogies Are Your Friend:**
    *   Complex systems need good mental models
    *   *Example:* "Your dopamine system is like a stock trader who only cares about surprises..."
    *   Test analogies for accuracy—a bad analogy teaches the wrong thing
*   **Embrace "We Don't Fully Know":**
    *   Science has edges and uncertainties—acknowledge them
    *   This builds trust and is more interesting than false certainty
*   **Logical Flow with Breathing Room:**
    *   Use clear headings and subheadings
    *   White space is your friend—dense walls of text feel academic, not engaging
    *   Section breaks let ideas land before moving on
*   **Concise but Not Compressed:**
    *   Eliminate genuinely unnecessary words
    *   But keep the words that add rhythm, personality, or breathing room
    *   A perfectly compressed sentence can feel robotic; a slightly looser one can feel human

## 4. Formatting and Emphasis for Readability

*   **Strategic Bolding:** Use **bold text** purposefully to highlight:
    *   Key terms upon introduction (e.g., **Patch**, **Diff**, **Fuzzy Matching**).
    *   Key takeaways or impactful statements, aiding skimmability.
    *   *Example:* "**This detailed attention to indentation is crucial**..."
*   **Code Formatting:** Use backticks for `inline code` and fenced code blocks (``` `````) for multi-line code, examples, or technical formats.
*   **Visual Aids:** Incorporate images or diagrams where they significantly aid understanding.
*   **References:** Use footnotes or a dedicated reference section.

## 5. Science Communication Principles

*   **Wonder First, Then Understanding:**
    *   Lead with what's surprising, counterintuitive, or fascinating
    *   The reader should *want* to understand the mechanism
*   **Connect to Human Experience:**
    *   Abstract science → "This is what happens when you can't stop scrolling"
    *   The reader should recognize themselves in the science
*   **Cross-Disciplinary Connections:**
    *   Neuroscience + Evolution + Psychology + Technology = richer understanding
    *   Show how different fields illuminate the same phenomenon
*   **Implications Matter:**
    *   Don't just explain what is—explore what it means
    *   "So what?" should never be left unanswered

## Summary

The style aims to make complex topics genuinely interesting. It draws from the best of science communication: Wait But Why's conversational depth and humor, Bryson's storytelling about scientists and discovery, and Sapolsky's layered approach from fundamentals to implications. The goal is for readers to finish feeling both smarter and entertained—and wanting to share what they learned.
